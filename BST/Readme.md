A new Folder Where Data Structure Programs For Binary Search Tree Will Be Uploaded





Binary Search Tree, is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:


The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the nodeâ€™s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the nodeâ€™s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
There must be no duplicate nodes.




struct node* search(struct node* root, int key) 
{ 
    // Base Cases: root is null or key is present at root 
    if (root == NULL || root->key == key) 
       return root; 
     
    // Key is greater than root's key 
    if (root->key < key) 
       return search(root->right, key); 
  
    // Key is smaller than root's key 
    return search(root->left, key); 
}
