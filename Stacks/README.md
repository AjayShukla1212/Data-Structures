Stacks :

Stacks are dynamic data structures that follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The last item to be inserted into a stack is the first one to be deleted from it.

For example, you have a stack of trays on a table. The tray at the top of the stack is the first item to be moved if you require a tray from that stack.

Inserting and deleting elements

Stacks have restrictions on the insertion and deletion of elements. Elements can be inserted or deleted only from one end of the stack i.e. from the top. The element at the top is called the top element. The operations of inserting and deleting elements are called push() and pop() respectively.

When the top element of a stack is deleted, if the stack remains non-empty, then the element just below the previous top element becomes the new top element of the stack.

Features of stacks

1.Dynamic data structures
2.Do not have a fixed size
3.Do not consume a fixed amount of memory
4.Size of stack changes with each push() and pop() operation. Each push() and pop() operation increases and decreases the size of the stack by 1, respectively.
